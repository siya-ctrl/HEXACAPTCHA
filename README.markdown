# Deep Learning-based System for Hexadecimal CAPTCHA Recognition and Parity Classification

## Description 
This project is a deep learning-based system designed to recognize hexadecimal CAPTCHAs and classify their parity (odd or even). It leverages advanced neural network models to decode hexadecimal patterns in CAPTCHA images and determine their numerical properties, providing an efficient solution for automated CAPTCHA solving and analysis.

## Features
- Recognizes hexadecimal patterns in CAPTCHA images using deep learning models.
- Classifies CAPTCHAs based on numerical parity (odd/even).
- Supports customizable model architectures for improved accuracy.
- Processes multiple CAPTCHA formats with high precision.

## Application
- Automated CAPTCHA solving for web accessibility testing.
- Security analysis of hexadecimal-based CAPTCHA systems.
- Research in deep learning for image recognition and numerical classification.
- Integration into automated systems requiring CAPTCHA verification.
